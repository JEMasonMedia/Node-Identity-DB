# Node-Identity-DB

Node-Identity-DB is a library to allow Node-Identity the ability to easily connect to any of the major database types, both SQL and Non-SQL. It uses mostly established and trusted libraries for each of the database types, such as Mongoose, Mysql, and PG and others, but it will have some unique tricks of it's own when used separately from Node-Identity. Imagine relational functionality with MongoDB and with the very same app, using the same models to work with SqlServer, or Mysql. I'm sure you can imagine how useful such could be for a lot of applications.

## Purpose

There are probably database tools similar to this out in the wild, but I figured I could, not reinvent the wheel, but create a tool that can work with any application, with any database, to allow for Node-Identity to be used easily, while providing a usefulness for many other things. One Model, Many Database's.

### Contribution

As this is an open source project, utilizing other open source libraries, I am absolutely welcome to the communities contributions to this project. It's definitely not a single coder job to build what I'm hoping to be a project library used across the entire internet. And being an open source project, there is no reason this couldn't end up one of the most secure authentication options available.
